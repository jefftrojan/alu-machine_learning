# 0x13-qa_bot
This directory contains work with QA Bot, Semantic Search, and BERT architecture:

## Mandatory Tasks:
0. [Question Answering](/supervised_learning/0x13-qa_bot/0-qa.py)
* Write a function that finds a snipper of text within a reference document to answer a question.
1. [Create the Loop](/supervised_learning/0x13-qa_bot/1-loop.py)
* Create a script that takes in input from the user with the prompt `Q:` and prints `A:` as a response.
2. [Answer Questions](/supervised_learning/0x13-qa_bot/2-qa.py)
* Based on the previous loop task, write a function that answers questions from a reference task in `Q:` and `A:` format.
3. [Semantic Search](/supervised_learning/0x13-qa_bot/3-semantic_search.py)
* Write a function that performs semantic search on a corpus of documents.
4. [Multi-Reference Question Answering](/supervised_learning/0x13-qa_bot/4-qa.py)
* Based on previous semantic search, write a function that answers questions from multiple reference texts.
