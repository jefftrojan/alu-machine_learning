# Hidden Markov Model
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that describes a sequence of observable events generated by a sequence of hidden states. The hidden states are not directly observable, but the observable events depend on the hidden states. The model assumes that the system being modeled is a Markov process with unobserved states. The hidden states are assumed to be Markov states, and the observable events are assumed to be conditionally independent of each other given the hidden states.

The HMM is a generative model that can be used to model sequences of events. The model is defined by a set of hidden states, a set of observable events, and a set of transition probabilities between the hidden states. The model is trained by estimating the transition probabilities from a set of training data, and then used to generate sequences of observable events.
